# Client-Server-Text

Each client will display a current list of other clients on the server.
• this list must update for each client as others join and drop from the server.
• Each client will have the ability to text an individual client, group or clients or all of the

clients at the same time.
• The server code must be thread safe. 
• You will use synchronization to accomplish this.
